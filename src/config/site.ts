  "I hold a PhD in Computer Science and work at the intersection of software verification and full-stack engineering. My focus is on bridging academic research with real-world practice by applying static analysis, model checking, and testing techniques to complex software systems, including operating systems and large-scale codebases.",
  "A significant part of my work is dedicated to visualization and web development, making verification results and technical data more accessible, interpretable, and useful for engineers and researchers alike.",
  "Outside of work, I’m a passionate traveler - I’ve visited 30+ countries, with a strong preference for calm, less-touristy places: mountains, lakes, remote islands, and snorkeling spots. I’m always drawn to quiet landscapes and hidden gems rather than crowded destinations."
