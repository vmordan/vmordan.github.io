This talk addresses the challenge of improving verification efficiency in real-world development workflows, where both **multiple properties** and **frequent software revisions** must be handled.

The presentation discusses practical approaches to **regression verification**, focusing on the reuse of verification results across program versions and their integration with **multi-property techniques** such as Multi-Aspect and Multi-Property Verification.

Experimental results demonstrate how these combinations reduce redundant verification effort while preserving result quality in large-scale verification tasks.
