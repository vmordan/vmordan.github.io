This talk explores practical extensions of verification techniques that check **multiple properties within a single workflow**, with a focus on empirical evaluation and configuration tuning.

The presentation covers:
- a comparison of **instrumentation** and **specification automata** for property formalization;
- further refinements of the **multi-aspect verification** method;
- sequential combinations of **multi-aspect verification** with **on-the-fly decomposition**;
- the impact of the **number of checked properties** on verification performance and results.

The talk is based on extensive experiments and highlights practical trade-offs encountered when scaling multi-property verification to real-world programs.
