This talk focuses on the **formal representation of complex properties** in software model checking, independent of the analyzed source code.

Instead of instrumenting the program, properties are expressed as **specification automata** and checked directly against the original code. The presentation reviews existing approaches in this area, identifies remaining open challenges, and demonstrates the practical benefits of separating specifications from implementation.

Such a separation enables more reusable, scalable, and maintainable verification workflows, and is particularly important for verifying large, real-world software systems.
