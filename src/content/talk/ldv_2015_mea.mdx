This talk presents **Multiple Error Analysis (MEA)**, a technique for discovering several bugs within a single verification workflow instead of stopping after the first error.

Applied to Linux kernel verification, MEA enabled the discovery of **over 200 new potential bugs**, while requiring only about **twice the runtime** of a basic single-error approach. At the same time, the number of error traces requiring manual inspection was reduced by **more than thirty times**.

The presentation emphasizes practical experience with MEA and its impact on large-scale, real-world verification tasks.
