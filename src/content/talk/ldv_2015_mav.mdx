This talk introduces **Multi-Aspect Verification (MAV)**, a method for checking several program properties simultaneously within a single verification run.

By sharing intermediate results across aspects, the MAV implementation significantly reduces redundant work, achieving up to a **5× speedup** compared to a basic single-aspect approach, while changing verification outcomes in only about **2% of cases**.

The presentation focuses on practical experience with MAV in the context of Linux driver verification.
