This talk presents early work on **visualizing static verification results** in the context of SV-COMP, laying the groundwork for what later evolved into the **Continuous Verification (CV)** framework.

The presentation introduces a technique for converting both **violation** and **correctness witnesses** into a human-readable form, enabling effective manual inspection. It demonstrates visualization of correctness witnesses through practical examples and presents a **web-based interface** for exploring verification results produced by **BenchExec**.

The proposed approach supports regression verification workflows and helps bridge the gap between automated verification tools and human understanding.
