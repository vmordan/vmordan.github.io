Applied advanced data race detection and concurrency analysis techniques,
including ThreadSanitizer, RaceHunter, and fuzzing-based approaches,
to large-scale software systems.

Target systems included:

- JSVM,
- PostgreSQL,
- QEMU,
- the Linux kernel, and
- OpenMP runtimes.

This work led to the discovery of multiple concurrency-related defects,
including subtle data races and synchronization issues,
followed by submission of bug reports and patches.
