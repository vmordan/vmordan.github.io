As part of the **Linux Driver Verification (LDV) Tools** project,
I made substantial contributions focused on extending verification coverage,
improving analysis scalability, and strengthening result reporting.

Key contributions:

- Added new rule specifications, significantly expanding verification coverage.
- Enhanced multi-violation reporting, increasing the number of detected bugs by approximately 50%.
- Designed infrastructure for multi-property verification, reducing overall computation time and resource usage.
- Developed a web-based reporting interface to communicate verified bugs to Linux kernel developers.
- Integrated additional verification engines to improve modular and cross-tool analysis.

These contributions improved the effectiveness of automated Linux kernel verification
and supported closer collaboration between verification researchers and kernel maintainers.
