**CPAchecker** is a large-scale, open-source verification framework widely used
in research and benchmarking for software verification.

My contributions focused on extending expressiveness and scalability
of property checking within the framework.

**Key contributions:**

- Extended the automata specification language to support complex,
  multi-condition properties.
- Implemented decomposition strategies for verifying multiple
  sub-specifications in parallel, improving analysis efficiency and coverage.

These enhancements improved verification precision
and influenced subsequent development of CPAchecker.
