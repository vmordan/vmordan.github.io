The **Continuous Verification Visualizer (CVV)** is a dedicated visualization platform
for software verification results, designed to support **continuous and regression verification**
workflows.

While conceptually inspired by earlier visualization components in Klever,
CVV was thoroughly redesigned and reimplemented with a different focus.
Unlike Klever, which aimed to provide an end-to-end and highly configurable verification framework,
CVV intentionally concentrates only on visualization and result analysis.

Key characteristics of CVV include:

- clear, human-readable presentation of verification results, error traces, and correctness proofs,
- a web-based interface optimized for manual inspection and analysis,
- comparison of verification results across software versions to support regression verification,
- custom visualization components implemented from scratch where existing solutions were insufficient.

By narrowing the scope and prioritizing usability,
CVV provides a practical and scalable solution for understanding
and tracking verification results over time.
