As part of **Google Summer of Code 2014**, I developed the **Public Pool of Bugs (PPoB)** —
an infrastructure for collecting, organizing, and sharing verified bugs
in Linux kernel modules detected by **LDV Tools**.

PPoB provides rich contextual information for each reported bug, including:

- affected Linux kernel versions,
- associated rule specifications,
- detailed error traces, and
- direct references to the corresponding source code.

The project helped bridge the gap between the software verification community
and Linux kernel developers, enabling faster bug analysis and contributing
to improved kernel reliability.
