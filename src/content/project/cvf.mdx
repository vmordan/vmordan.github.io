The **Continuous Verification Framework** is a purpose-built infrastructure
for preparing and solving verification tasks for a given software system.
It focuses on systematic **decomposition of verification problems**
and automated execution using **CPAchecker** as the underlying analysis engine.

In contrast to more generic and complex frameworks such as **Klever**,
this framework was intentionally kept minimal and specialized,
covering exactly the functionality required in practice.

It was applied to multiple real-time and operating system–level projects,
where static verification was used to detect rare and hard-to-reproduce bugs
in proprietary code bases.
