**Witness Visualizer** is a standalone tool for converting generic verification
witnesses produced by SV-COMP–compliant tools into clear, human-readable
visual representations.

The tool supports visualization of both error traces and correctness proofs.
It operates independently of any specific verification framework and can be used
as an auxiliary tool for analyzing verification results.

Given a set of witnesses and the corresponding source code, Witness Visualizer:

- filters and groups equivalent witnesses,
- generates human-readable visualizations for unique witnesses.

Conceptually, it continues the ideas explored in the Public Pool of Bugs (PPoB) project,
bringing framework-independent inspection of verification results to modern
SV-COMP workflows.
