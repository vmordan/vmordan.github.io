We present CV (Continuous Verification), a framework for regression verification that transforms machine-readable, SV-COMP-compliant results into interactive, human-readable visualizations. CV assists software developers by presenting error traces, correctness proofs, and overall statistics in a concise and accessible form, thereby reducing the effort required for manual analysis of verification results. In addition, it supports regression verification by comparing outcomes across software versions and highlighting new results, including potential bugs and correctness proofs.

Although originally developed for SV-COMP, CV is applicable to any verification benchmark that follows the SV-COMP format, including real-world software such as Linux kernel modules. CV is available as open-source software.
